Nokia 9 will be sporting the latest generation Snapdragon 835 chipset from Qualcomm alongside a 3,800mAh battery as per earlier reports. Hence, the delay in the launch of their new smartphone makes sense. This is due to Qualcomm's exclusivity of the chipset with Samsung for their Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus smartphones.
