Sunil Grover fans, there’s a reason why you woke up this morning feeling the universe was a little less complicated than it was yesterday: Your favourite funny man, Mashoor Gulati aka Dr Gulati is back.

Before you think Sunil’s back on Sony TV’s The Kapil Sharma Show, here’s is what exactly happened.
For now, the channel has managed to get Sunil back, as he will apparently be seen as Dr Mashoor Gulati and Rinku Bhabhi - his famous characters on Kapil’s show. Spotboye has reported that Sunil was seen shooting in Film City on Wednesday for Indian Idol, which reaches its finale this weekend.

While his fans will be happy to see him reprising the famous characters, the future of Kapil’s show is still hanging in balance. According to reports, Sunil has told the channel that he won’t report to the sets of Kapil’s show anymore. Since he’s still bound by contract with the channel, he readily agreed to be on Indian Idol.
Meanwhile, The Kapil Sharma Show finally got a new member in Raju Srivastava. The comedian has confirmed that he is here to stay and has not entered Kapil’s show for just one episode.

Shrivastav told NDTV on Wednesday, “Yes, I have started shooting for this show. The channel and the team are happy with the episodes I have shot for them and have called me for more episodes.”
