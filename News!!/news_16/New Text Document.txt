The Nokia 9 – AKA the Nokia Android phone we’ve ALL been waiting for – will launch inside Q3, reports suggest

HMD’s revival of the Nokia brand is now officially in motion. After a stellar performance at MWC 2017, the Nokia brand is officially back in contention for 2017. Though anyone waiting for a true flagship from Nokia will have to wait until Q3.

Word on the street suggests Nokia is prepping the Nokia 9 – HMD’s first “flagship-grade” phone – for launch inside Q3. The handset will apparently retail for €749/$699, so you can expect some pretty meaty specs and a decent smattering of big, headline-grabbing USPs.

News of the launch comes via Nokia Power User, which claims the handset could launch anytime between July and August – so, right before the arrival of Apple’s iPhone 8. The handset itself should be released well before the iPhone 8 arrives, however, giving HMD a nice run at the market.

The Nokia 9 will be available in two storage versions, apparently: 64GB and 128GB, though it will not run OLED panels, as Apple has apparently snaffled all those up for its iPhone 8.

The Nokia 9 is expected to feature the following, key specs:

QHD Display
Snapdragon 835 CPU 
6GB of RAM 
22MP camera (potentially Carl Zeiss)
The Nokia 9 could also be HMD’s first VR-ready phone. HMD has its own VR platform – OZO – and we expect the Nokia 9 to be the first handset to work with it; expect plenty of fancy 3D features and advanced audio.

The current Nokia OZO camera retails for around $45,000 – so, that one’s a little out of most people’s price range. However, given how big VR is getting, we imagine Nokia has something more egalitarian lined up for punters.
