Comedian and actor Kapil Sharma who has been running The Kapil Sharma Show since 2 weeks without Sunil Grover, is reportedly done convincing his colleague.
Kapil who apologised on Twitter and otherwise to Sunil for his misbehaviour inside the flight has reportedly given up after plenty of trying.

Clearly, Sunil Grover is in no mood to forgive and now Kapil has also made peace with him.
Speaking to a leading daily, a source said, "When you keep trying, apologise, try over and over again to convince someone and the person is still unmoved, then there's no point left. Kapil has stopped taking any effort now. He did a lot and he had enough. Not only him, a lot of other people involved with the show, the topmost authorities tried talking to Sunil but he is not ready to change his mind."
Earlier there were rumours of Sunil Grover joining the show back at a higher salary but he dismissed these rumours with his tweet too.
Sunil was last seen performing in a Delhi gig playing the role of Rinku Bhabhi and Dr. Mashoor Gulati.
