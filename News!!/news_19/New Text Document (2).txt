New Delhi: Ace comedians Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover's much-talked-about brawl only seems to be worsening with time. Even after public apologies by the 'Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon' hunk, Sunil doesn’t seem to be satisfied much and there are still no signs of him returning to 'The Kapil Sharma Show'.

Amidst all this, it is also being said that Sunil will soon be coming up with his own new show. However, there is no official confirmation about the same. But, if Sunil pulls this off then it would definitely harm the viewership of Kapil's program.

Sunil's on-screen characters – Dr Mashoor Gulati, Rinku Bhabhi – are popular among the audience of all age groups. And, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Sunil brought his fair share of the viewers to 'TKSS'.

It is also expected that Sunil will introduce more of such funny characters on his own show and give cut-throat competition to Kapil.
On the other hand, even Kapil is trying hard to fill the void created by Sunil's absence by bringing in more comedians like Raju Srivastava. After facing the social media wrath, thankfully, his show has now once again started picking up steam.
