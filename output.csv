"The Barcelona boss believes his side have what it takes to make a historic comeback against PSG and reach the next round.

Luis Enrique remains optimistic over Barcelona's chances of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Paris Saint-Germain and believes they could score six goals in Wednesday's return clash at Camp Nou.

The Catalans were hammered 4-0 in the first leg at the Parc des Princes, but Luis Enrique has not given up hope of staging a dramatic comeback.

Xavi wants to be Barcelona coach

""We are only halfway through the tie,"" the outgoing Barcelona coach told a news conference. ""There are 95 minutes left and lots of things can happen.

""I go into the game with a positive mood. We have to do everything really well, both in defence and in attack. PSG are a really good side.

""Of course, lots of things have happened since the first leg. We have improved and have put in some good performances. We are optimistic by nature and convinced of what we can do. We will try to make the most of the favourable circumstances.

""If a team can score four times against us, we can score six times against them. We have seen that before this season. We have nothing to lose.

""My optimism does not mean I have unbreakable faith, but there are all sorts of performances in sports, negatives and positives. We have not been in a situation like this before, but I have faith in the team. You always have to keep your emotions in check. 

""I am not interested in becoming part of history. But I am convinced we will get chances. That does not mean it is definitely going to happen, but I think we can get close and boost morale even further, which could affect our opponents.

""I don't have the feeling that we need the best game since I got here. We obviously have to play well and really effective. But it depends on how the match goes.

""Penalties on the training pitch are nothing like penalties in a big game. We have not trained penalties. I am not worried about penalties.""

Barcelona will need star player Lionel Messi to be at his very best if they are to turn things around, but Luis Enrique is adamant it is all about the team effort.

""I look at all my players and they all have the attitude necessary,"" he added.

""I know everybody likes to focus on Messi and he is a point of reference who can make the difference, but this is going to be a team effort. The team effort is what matters."""	3
"Barcelona's amazing 6-1 victory over Paris St Germain on Wednesday that sent them through to the Champions League quarter-finals will forever stay in the memories of supporters, coach Luis Enrique said.

The Spanish champions, who lost the first leg 4-0 and were facing their earliest exit from the competition since 2007, struck three late goals in six minutes to complete an extraordinary comeback.

""Any child in the Nou Camp tonight will never forget this and neither will the adults. This is a unique sport for crazy people,"" Luis Enrique told reporters. ""This is a night which is difficult to explain in words, it had the script of a horror film with a spectacular start with an atmosphere which I have never seen in the Nou Camp, with tension I have never seen before.""

No side in 61 years of the European Cup had ever gone through after losing the first leg of a knockout tie by four goals and Luis Enrique paid tribute to the fans who stood by the team after their harrowing defeat at the Parc des Princes.

""I would like to thank everyone who kept their faith after we lost 4-0. This is dedicated to them because this isn't the Harlem Globetrotters, this is football,"" he said, referring to the famous American exhibition basketball team. ""I don't think anyone stopped believing. We risked everything and it paid off. You get finales like this very occasionally in football and this time it was our turn,"" Luis Enrique said. ""It was an explosion of sentiment, I'm not an emotional person but I enjoyed this just as much as those that were moved to tears.""

Barca forward Neymar, who scored twice in the space of three minutes before Sergi Roberto's 95th-minute clincher, said it was the best performance of his career, in which he has won the Champions League and an Olympic gold medal with Brazil.

""It's the best game I've played in my life, because of the whole story, the goals and for what it means to the team,"" Neymar told BeIN sports. ""It looked like the tie was over after losing in Paris and now we're playing without responsibility, with happiness. The first week after Paris was tough but we rediscovered our football and since the second week we couldn't wait for this game to come around.""

Barca defender Gerard Pique, meanwhile, predicted a surge in the birth rate in Catalonia, as occurred in 2009 following Andres Iniesta's stoppage-time leveller against Chelsea which took Barca into the Champions League final. ""I advise the hospitals of Barelona to start hiring nurses because a lot of love is going to be made tonight,"" he said.

""I was brought to my knees. I would like to thank everyone who kept their faith after we lost 4-0. This is dedicated to them because this isn’t the Harlem Globetrotters, this is football,"" added Enrique. ""I don’t think anyone stopped believing. After seeing them sitback despite the goal, the team were incredible,"" he added.

""We risked everything and it paid off. You get finales like this very occasionally in football and this time it was our turn,"" added Enrique who is leaving the club at the end of the season. ""A feat like this does everyone good and I’m delighted to enjoy a moment like this. The key was our efficiency. The sixth goal was scored with the hope of the fan who was on the other side of the world."""	3
"The Supreme Court today said the Aadhaar card can't be made mandatory by the government for extending the benefits of its welfare schemes to the people.
The apex court, however, said the government cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar - or the the unique identification number - in other schemes like the opening of bank accounts.
Last week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the Aadhaar card may become the only identity card in future, and will be mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns to curb tax evasion and frauds.
Replying to the debate on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said that Aadhaar may become the only card in future replacing all other types of identity cards such as Voter ID and PAN cards.
The government has also said the Aadhaar card is a must for anyone seeking to obtain or renew a driver's license, a new telephone number as well as for existing connections to stay operational after February 2018.
In a controversial decision, it has also been mandated for children to get their mid-day meals and for 11 other government schemes.
The critics of Aadhaar claim the government is violating a Supreme Court order of October 2015 which specified that the Universal Identification Document cannot be made mandatory for government schemes.
The Supreme Court today said it will set up a seven-judge bench to hear the pleas challenging Aadhaar. ""But right now, it is not possible,"" a bench of Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said.
Senior counsel Shyam Divan had challenged a spare of orders issued by the government making Aadhaar mandatory to access benefits under various schemes. 
The apex court refused to give an early date to hear a petition on making the biometric-based identity number mandatory, saying it would hear the case in due course of time.
A number of Opposition parties walked out of Lok Sabha last week, accusing the government of forcing Indians to get Aadhaar cards."	2
"Three goals in the final seven minutes of the game - two of which came in stoppage time - saw Barcelona perform arguably the greatest comeback in Champions League history against Paris Saint-Germain.

Edinson Cavani's goal in the 62nd minute looked to have broken Barcelona hearts, but the Catalan giants rallied and Sergi Roberto's late strike saw them run out 6-1 winners on the night and 6-5 on aggregate.

For all the world it looked as though comeback was off; Cavani's volley from inside the area silenced the home support and drained Barcelona of all life. At 3-1, the game was over. His 38th goal in 37 matches for the French champions killed off any hopes of a Barcelona comeback.

Barcelona had stormed into a 3-0 lead in the opening hour of this evening's clash at the Nou Camp. Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and a rather fortunate own-goal saw the atmosphere within the stadium lift and one of Europe's heavyweights were on the ropes. 

Suarez had the home side in front within three minutes of play. A cross into the PSG box was knocked back into the six-yard box and the Uruguayan got to the ball ahead of Kevin Trapp. His flick took it over the line, despite attempts to clear.

From here, Barcelona ramped up the pressure. Knowing the size of the task they had ahead of themselves, Luis Enrique's side squeezed PSG into their own half. Possession was won back quickly - or given away cheaply, depending on what side of the fence you were on.

Unai Emery's team looked nervous and any rushed clearances were brought down by the high Barcelona defensive line and redistributed. 

Chances came at a relentless pace in the opening 20 minutes. 

Javier Marscherano's volley from the edge of the box flew wide, before Lionel Messi fired high over the bar from a freekick. Neymar threatened on occasion and his effort from the top right hand corner of the box just didn't have enough bend to find its way into the top corner. 

The own-goal came as a result of Andres Iniesta's jinking run and Layvin Kurzawa turned into his own net.

PSG had a speculative effort through Lucas Moura, but the effort was saved comfortably. Messi's penalty just five minutes into the second half gave them another boost.

But with PSG having secured a precious away goal just 12 minutes later, Barcelona made a halfhearted attempt at a comeback. Substitute Arda Turan had a ball cleared off the line, before Angel Di Maria had the chance to kill off the game.

His dinked effort went wide of the post and the clock ticked down.

Then up stepped Neymar.

After Barcelona won a freekick to the left-hand side of PSG goal, the Brazilian struck a wonderful strike at the near post to beat Trapp.

This was the catalyst and only moments later, Suarez was bundled over in the box. Having already been booked for simulation, the Uruguayan was given the benefit of the decision and Neymar scored his second in quick succession.

Their winner came in the fifth and final minute of added time. A high lofted ball into the PSG box wasn't dealt with and Roberto was at the back post to turn the ball home, sparking scenes of delirium around the stadium.

PSG will rightly look back at this as a game they threw away, but take nothing away from the magnitude of the win, something that will surely propel them to be real contenders this year.

Elsewhere tonight, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick as Borussia Dortmund came from 1-0 down on aggregate to win 4-1 and secure their place in the quarter-final."	3
"Aadhaar cannot be mandatory for central welfare schemes, the Supreme Court said today, but added that it cannot stop the government from linking the 12-digit identification number to the opening of bank accounts or filing of tax returns.

The government recently made it mandatory for citizens to produce the 12-digit Aadhaar number for benefits under nearly three dozen central schemes including free mid-day meals for schoolchildren. Aadhaar was also made compulsory for scholarships and other schemes for backward castes and the disabled. Aadhaar cards are mandatory for subsidized cooking gas and foodgrains.

The government has said it will enable people to get their biometric identity documents by June 30.

Aadhaar cards will also be needed for filing tax returns - a move that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says will check tax evasion.

The Supreme Court today said it cannot stop the government from doing so but reiterated its earlier order that Aadhaar cannot be mandatory for people to benefits under official welfare schemes.


Last week, responding to opposition criticism in parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that Aadhaar may soon become the only card required to identify a person, replacing Voter IDs and PAN or Permanent Account Number. He said as many as 98 per cent or 108 crore people have Aadhaar numbers.

The government has said that until all beneficiaries are assigned Aadhaar cards, subsidized foodgrain will be provided on ration cards and Aadhaar enrolment slips or a copy of an applicant's request for Aadhaar enrolment.

The centre has asked states to link Aadhaar numbers with the ration card or with bank accounts for cash transfer of food subsidy.

The use of Aadhaar as the identity document for benefits or subsidies simplifies delivery and helps make the system more transparent and efficient, the government says."	2
"Uber’s self-driving vehicles are in hot waters once again. Yesterday, one of these Volvo test vehicles was involved in a terrible accident and now the company has suspended its complete self-driving fleet. Yes, all autonomous vehicles operating across Arizona, Pittsburgh and also San Francisco have been grounded.

As reported earlier, one of Uber’s self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs was involved in a seemingly terrible car crash in Tempe, Arizona. But, the autonomous vehicle was not at fault and said to be operating in the self-driving mode when a car failed to yield and crashed directly into the Uber’s Volvo. The intensity of this collision left the self-driving car toppled on its side but no serious injuries were reported. It only had one Uber engineer in the driver’s seat and was not ferrying any passengers at that instant of time.

An Uber spokesperson confirmed the same to NYT and further said,

We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no back-seat passengers in the vehicle.

Further, following in line with numerous media reports, the Uber spokesperson then continued to add that it was suspending public road trials in Arizona. This suspension was previously only being extended to Arizona, pending results of their ongoing investigation into yesterday’s accident. But, Uber has now decided to halt operations of its self-driving vehicles across all existing trial locations.

This means you’ll not witness any autonomous Uber vehicles driving down the streets of Pittsburgh (where it initiated its public trials), as well as San Francisco (California, where it secured a permit and returned recently). There is currently no set duration for the self-driving fleet’s suspension in other locations except Arizona. The spokesperson confirmed that the vehicles will continue to remain grounded in Arizona until results of their investigation are out but there is no word about the same in other regions. With regards to the same, the spokesperson added,

Our vehicles in Arizona remain grounded while we continue our investigation. Our vehicles are grounded in Pittsburgh and SF today as well.

The timing of this development is pretty unfortunate for Uber, which is currently caught amid surmounting controversies. And they’re not limited to their technological development but more prominently linked to the company’s culture. A former employee slapped the company with allegations of sexual harassment and sexism in the workplace last month. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had also been seen arguing with an Uber Black driver over their pricing schemes in a leaked video.

Kalanick has already called an investigation into the said allegations, but it has already affected the company brand image among the consumers (the #DeleteUber campaign) and the employees (multiple exits ranging from President Jeff Jones to researchers at Uber ATC).

For those unaware, Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving division has filed a patent infringement lawsuit along with an injunction stating that Uber’s self-driving technology is built using sensitive data stolen from their company. It believes that former Googler Anthony Lewandowski took off with over 9.7 GB of trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation to build a self-driving truck startup Otto, which was bought by Uber.

And the accident has further justified an internal report which suggested that the company is having is having a tough time optimizing its self-driving tech. As per the report, Uber’s miles per intervention (which is the number of miles driven by a car before a human has to take over for any reason) stood at .9 miles in January. In February, the car had managed to cross the one-mile landmark. However, it has dropped right back down to .8 miles this month. So, in short, a full load of troubles in Uber’s piggy bank at the moment."	1
"The Supreme Court on Monday said the government cannot make Aadhaar mandatory for extending benefits of central welfare schemes, but added that it cannot stop the government from linking the 12-digit identification number to the opening of bank accounts or filing of tax returns.

The bench comprised of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul.

Recently, the government made it mandatory for citizens to produce the 12-digit Aadhaar number for benefits under dozens of central schemes - free mid-day meals for schoolchildren, scholarships, subsidised cooking gas and foodgrains and other schemes for backward castes and the disabled.

Aadhaar cards will also be needed for filing tax returns. The Centre has indicated that PAN cards could be invalidated by year-end if not linked with Aadhaar.

The government had said it will enable people to get their biometric identity documents by June 30.

A clutch of petitions challenging the orders, and Aadhaar, are pending in the SC.

The bench also said that a seven-judge bench needed to be constituted for authoritatively deciding a batch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar scheme on grounds including that it infringes on the Right to Privacy of citizens.

It, however, expressed inability in setting up of the seven-judge bench saying it would be decided at a later stage.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, alleged that the Central government is not following the various orders passed by the apex court that the usage of Aadhaar would be voluntary and not mandatory.

The apex court on August 11, 2015, had said that Aadhaar card will not be mandatory for availing benefits of government's welfare schemes and barred the authorities from sharing personal biometric data collected for enrolment under the scheme.

However, on October 15, 2015 it had lifted its earlier restriction and permitted the voluntary use of Aadhaar cards in welfare schemes that also included MGNREGA, all pension schemes and the provident fund besides ambitious flagship programmes like 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna' of the NDA government.

A five-judge bench headed by the then Chief Justice H L Dattu had also put a caveat in its interim order for the Centre and said, ""We also make it clear that Aadhaar card scheme is purely voluntary and not mandatory till the matter is finally decided by this court, this way or the other way.""

The bench, while including the four other schemes along with LPG and PDS where Aadhaar may be used, had said, ""The Union of India to follow all other orders passed by this court since September 23, 2013.""

Divan, representing one of the petitioners who has challenged the Aadhaar card scheme, had claimed that the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which runs the programme, is neither backed by any law nor by any notification and is getting biometric details through private agencies.

The lawyers for the petitioners had contended that the scheme is ""all-pervasive"" and is not full proof either and hence, cannot be used for other programmes.

On October 14, 2015, the apex court took note of Centre's plea that Aadhaar cards be allowed to be used ""voluntarily"" for welfare programmes other than PDS and LPG schemes and asked whether it can assure that nobody would be at a ""disadvantageous"" position for want of Aadhaar."	2
"This was greatest comeback in Champions League history. Perhaps football history too.

Sergi Roberto’s stoppage time strike helped Barcelona come back from 4-0 down against PSG to complete an astonishing 6-1 victory.

Edinson Cavani seemed to have crushed Barcelona’s hopes of an unprecedented result with a vicious half-volley after the Catalans scored three, but Luis Enrique’s side refused to give in and went and scored three more.

Luis Suarez opened the scoring after three minutes and Andres Iniesta forced Layvin Kurzawa into an own goal just before the break.

Lionel Messi blasted home at the third from the penalty spot before Cavani smashed home to poop the party—or so it seemed.

Neymar intervened with two goals in the final few minutes, before setting up one for Sergi Roberto in the 94th minute to send the Camp Nou into pandemonium.

1. This is why football makes us dream.
Cold hard logic dictated that Barcelona would not be able to comeback from such a brutal deficit, but the impossible being made reality is what keeps us coming back to football time and time again.

In the build-up Luis Enrique insisted that if PSG could score four against his team in Paris then Barcelona could hit them for six at the Camp Nou. That a comeback was even thinkable is incredible in itself.

And Barcelona’s self-belief tripled when Suarez headed home after just three minutes. They racked up the pressure and the chances, pelting Kevin Trapp’s goal.

The crucial second came five minutes before half-time, with Messi adding the third five minutes after it.

Then, disaster. Cavani lashed home from 15 yards, and resignation spread like wildfire around the stadium. It had been some effort, but that looked to be that.

Luis Enrique said in his pre-match press conference that it wasn’t in Barcelona fans’ culture to turn the Camp Nou into a cauldron, somewhere like the San Paolo on a big European night.

Instead he asked the fans to create waves of pressure, which they did, and his team rode them as they dominated PSG.

Banners were hung up around the city on Tuesday night by Barcelona’s ultras, with messages of support for the team, and that atmosphere was carried into the stadium, which has rarely seen as raucous an evening as this, especially in the past few years.

Flags were waved in every stand, huge canvases were wielded around the stadium, with the largest draped down from the grandstand reading ‘Everyone with the team’.

And a stadium which can often feel like a theatre as fans politely applaud the art presented to them was transformed into a furious bowl of fire, with PSG shaken by it and Barcelona energised."	3
