The Supreme Court on Monday said the government could not make Aadhaar mandatory for extending benefits of its welfare schemes.

The government, however, could not be stopped from using Aadhaar in other schemes like opening of bank accounts, it said.
A seven-judge Bench has to be set up to hear the pleas challenging Aadhaar but right now it is not possible, the apex court said.
