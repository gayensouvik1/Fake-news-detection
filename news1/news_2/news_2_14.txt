In a major setback to Centre, the Supreme Court on Monday stated that the government cannot make Aadhaar card mandatory for extending benefits of its welfare schemes. However, the Court said that it cannot stop the government from using Aadhaar for other schemes like Income Tax.
Chief Justice of India JS Khehar stated that “Aadhaar can’t be mandatory for social welfare schemes but can be used for non-benefit schemes. Our earlier order is very clear. You can’t stop the government from using Aadhaar for non-benefit schemes like Income Tax.”
The government had recently made it mandatory for the citizens to have Aadhaar for receiving the benefits of nearly three dozen schemes which also included mid-day meals for the school children. The biometric document is also mandatory for getting the subsidised cooking gas and food grains. Making Aadhaar compulsory for schemes like backward castes, disabled and scholarships, the government stated that it would help people in getting their Aadhaar by June 30.

The court further stated that a seven-judge bench has to be set up for hearing the petitions challenging Aadhaar. Retired Karnataka High Court judge, Justice K S Puttaswamy in 2012 filed a petition against Aadhaar claiming that the UID scheme infringes upon the citizen’s right to privacy. The petition further states that there is no system that would ensure that the biometric of the citizens would be safe and will not be misused.
Subsequently, similar petitions were filed by many NGOs and activists throughout the country. A three-judge bench on August 11, 2015, referred the matter to the Constitution Bench to ascertain whether the Constitution guarantees the right to privacy, and if it does, what are its source and contours.
