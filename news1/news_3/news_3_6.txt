How did they do that?

Barcelona's stunning comeback to beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-5 on aggregate to reach the last eight of the Champions League was something which quite simply had to be seen to be believed, but it did actually happen.

After a Luis Suarez strike, a Layvin Kurzawa own goal and a Lionel Messi penalty, Edinson Cavani's away goal looked to have put the tie beyond the hosts , only for Neymar to strike twice in the closing minutes and then Sergi Roberto to remarkably pop up with the winner five minutes into stoppage time.

Barca stars Samuel Umtiti, Javier Mascherano and Ivan Rakitic were the first to post from the changing rooms followed by a VERY excited Luis Suarez.

After scoring the winner, Sergi Roberto later hailed his team-mates and supporters said: "AMAZING! Together we made it! Huge fans and team!"
