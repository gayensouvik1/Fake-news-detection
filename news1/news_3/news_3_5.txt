It began as an ordinary Wednesday featuring some Champions League action for soccer fans to look forward to.

It ended up being an extraordinary Wednesday featuring one of the greatest soccer comebacks of all time.

Barcelona suffered a 4-0 loss in the first leg of their Round of 16 matchup with Paris SG last month. Even with a valiant effort from the Catalan in Wednesday’s game, advancing to the quarterfinals seemed like a fool’s errand for Lionel Messi and company.

Barcelona wasn’t going out without a fight, however, and was up 2-0 at halftime. Messi scored on a penalty kick in the 50th minute to make it 3-0 but 12 minutes later Edinson Cavani scored an away goal for PSG to cut the lead to 3-1. At this point most onlookers wouldn’t entertain the idea of a Barcelona comeback.

The score sat at 3-1 for more than 25 minutes when Neymar made it 4-1 in the 88th. The young superstar scored on a penalty three minutes later then Sergi Roberto netted the winner five minutes into injury time to complete the improbable comeback.

Most fans watching couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Others figured it was a wrap and stopped watching entirely.

Here’s some of the best reaction to the epic comeback.
