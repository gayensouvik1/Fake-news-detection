New Delhi: Home-grown ecommerce player Flipkart has acquired the India operation unit of global ecommerce player eBay.in. Flipkart has signed an exclusive agreement with eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) and as per the agreement, eBay, in exchange for an equity stake in Flipkart, will make a $500 million cash investment and sell its eBay.in business to Flipkart. 

Following the deal, Flipkart will own and operate the eBay.in business upon the close of the transaction. eBay and Flipkart will jointly pursue cross-border trade opportunities to make eBay’s global inventory accessible to more India consumers, while eBay’s millions of active buyers globally will have access to more unique Indian inventory provided by Flipkart.

“The combination of eBay’s position as a leading global eCommerce company and Flipkart’s market stature will allow us to accelerate and maximize the opportunity for both companies in India,” said Devin Wenig, president and CEO of eBay Inc.

“This partnership between Flipkart and eBay is the coming together of two pioneering innovators who have disrupted commerce by applying technology. It bodes well for Indian and global customers, sellers and the wider eCommerce ecosystem. eBay.in has built a strong presence in India over the years and we hope to take it to greater heights as part of the Flipkart group,” said Binny Bansal, group CEO, Flipkart.

Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected later this year, Flipkart will acquire eBay’s buyers in India. eBay will remove the number of active buyers in India from its reporting during the quarter in which the transaction closes.
