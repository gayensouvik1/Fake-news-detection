In the German city of Dortmund, three explosions damaged a bus carrying the soccer team Borussia Dortmund as it was heading to the Champions League quarterfinal match against Monaco. Marc Bartra, a Spanish defender, was injured.

The playoff has been postponed until this evening. On Twitter, some Dortmund fans offered free accommodation for their rival team’s stranded supporters under the hashtag #bedforawayfans.
