Nokia made its way back at the Mobile World Congress this year in Barcelona and gripped consumers’ interest with three smartphones -- Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and the Nokia D6 along with the new avatar of Nokia 3310.

However, speculations have been rife for sometime that Nokia will come out with a true premium flagship smartphone to try and take centre stage among Android giants like Samsung, HTC and LG.

And that smartphone could very well be the Nokia 9. According to a new report posted by a website ‘nokiapoweruser’, some specifications of the Nokia 9 has been leaked.
As per report, the Nokia 9 will be the first Nokia device to feature ‘Nokia OZO Audio’ enhancements and it will feature a 5.5-inch QHD OLED display. It said to be powered by a Snapdragon 835, along with Adreno 540 GPU. It will come with 6GB of RAM and 64GB/128GB of internal storage. The smartphone will run on Android 7.1.2 Nougat operating system and will be backed up by a 3,800mAh battery with Qualcomm Quick-Charge 4 support. 
On the camera front, the smartphone will sport a 22-megapixel dual Carl-Zeiss rear camera and a 12-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies. The smartphone is also said to house a fingerprint scanner and will also feature an Iris scanner as well. Further, the Nokia 9 will have IP68 certification for water and dust resistance.

If all the specifications are true, then the phone could be a worthy challenger to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the forthcoimg Google Pixel 2.
