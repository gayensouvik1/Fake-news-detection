Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover have given the viewers of the small screen two hit shows - The Kapil Sharma Show and Comedy Nights With Kapil. Thanks to the generous dose of laughter that they offer, the audience loves the two comedians for their super comic timing and backing each other always.
Post the ugly spat, more than anybody else, the fans of the two have been affected by Sunil's absence on the show. In order to get them back again, they have been using the hashtag #GetBackKapilSunil on the internet.
Kapil's rise to fame began when he was one of the contestants on The Great Indian Laughter Challenge. From playing the role of Inpector Shamsher back then to having his own show now, he has come a long way indeed.
Talking about the diversity in their characters, Sunil Grover is someone who always experiments with unique gags for the audience bringing something fresh with every episode. Doctor Mashoor Gulati and Rinku Bhabhi are his most loved characters from the show.
Here is hoping the dynamic duo come together and recreate their magic on screen.
