An up and coming Australian model is believed to have wooed the fastest man in the world Usain Bolt.
The Olympic gold medallist and Holly Young, from Perth, have been spotted enjoying nights out and lavish meals in Munich, Germany, this week, according to The West Australian.
The millionaire flew Ms Young from Miami to Germany so they could spend time together, according to The West Australian. 
Bolt is still believed to be dating Kasi Bennett, who is based in Jamaica. 
Bolt landed himself in hot water during the Rio 2016 Olympics after several images of the athlete kissing random women emerged.
