Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told off a group of miscreants who insistently raised slogans in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Aam Aadmi Party's rally in Delhi today.
Kejriwal, who was campaigning for his party ahead of the municipal polls in Delhi, was repeatedly getting interrupted by the cries of 'Modi, Modi' from certain sections of the audience.
In a bid to shut up the dissenters, the AAP convenor launched a salvo against the Prime Minister.
"Ask these people if chanting 'Modi, Modi' can get their house tax waived off. Did Modi reduce the electricity tariff? If that is the case, then I too will shout 'Modi, Modi'," declared Kejriwal, which earned him a round of applause and chuckles from party workers and supporters.
Taking the jibe one step further, Kejriwal said, "Modi, Modi karne se pet nahi bharta (Shouting 'Modi, Modi' won't satiate your hunger)... Some people have gone mad," the chief minister said.
AAP supporters promptly launched into a chorus of 'Kejriwal, Kejriwal' following their leader's remarks.
Kejriwal then recounted the AAP government's decisions to slash power tariff by half and provide water free of cost (capped at 20,000 litres per connection every month) and reforms in the areas of education and health.
"Where did we get the money? We did one thing, we ended corruption. We have saved Rs 350 crore from the construction of five flyovers in the last two years," the Delhi chief minister said.
He promised to make Delhi sparkling clean within a year and to shore up the revenues of the cash-strapped corporations that have faced a series of strikes by sanitation workers over non-payment of salaries.
