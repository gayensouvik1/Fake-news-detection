A probe has been ordered after 400 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans at Kerala’s Pallipuram fell ill due to suspected food poisoning, reports said Sunday.

The 400 security personnel were admitted to various hospitals on Saturday night after they complained of upset stomach and vomiting. They were served fish for dinner.

As many as 109 jawans were under observation at Trivandrum medical college hospital, where health minister KK Shylaja visited them on Saturday night.

“The condition of four was a bit serious when they arrived here, but they have quickly responded to the treatment,” the hospital superintendent said.

Most of the jawans were discharged by Sunday morning.

The men were trainees who had come from different parts of the country.

The quality of food and other facilities available to paramilitary personnel have been a matter of debate after a Border Security Force man posted a video, complaining about the quality of meals served to them.

Another video purportedly posted by a CRPF jawan complained of the paramilitary forces not being provided same facilities as the army. The soldier requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention.
