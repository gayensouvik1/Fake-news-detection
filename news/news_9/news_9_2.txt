An enquiry has been ordered after complaints of suspected food poisoning at a CRPF camp in Kerala, news agency ANI reported. At least 400 jawans at the camp in Pallipuram in state capital Thiruvananthapuram started vomiting and complained of stomach ache after consuming food Saturday night. While many of them were admitted to hospitals in the city, 109 jawans are said to be under observation at the Trivandrum medical college hospital.
Health Minister Shylaja visited the jawans in hospital and took stock of the situation.
“The condition of four was a bit serious when they arrived here, but they have quickly responded to the treatment,” the hospital superintendent told IANS.
