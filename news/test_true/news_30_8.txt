Comedian Sunil Grover has announced his new gig with Kiku Sharda following his fall out with Kapil Sharma.

Grover took to Facebook to share the poster of his upcoming gig scheduled to happen in Delhi on April 1. It’s the Fool’s Day, but the poster doesn’t seem like a prank.
Following an in-flight tussle between him and Kapil, Grover posted a note on social media in which he asked the latter to “start respecting human beings also apart from animals.”

Grover, who plays the popular characters of Dr Gulati and Rinku Bhabhi on Kapil’s show, further wrote, “Thanks for making me realise it was your show and you have power to throw out anybody, anytime.

“You are the wittiest, and the best in your field. But don’t act like a ‘God’. Take good care of yourself. Wish you lot more success and fame.”
Kapil had dismissed their feud as “an argument” in a Facebook post but Grover, has indicated that all is not well between them.

He also took to Twitter to apologise to Grover, saying, “Sorry if I hurt you unintentionally. You know very well how much I love you. I am also upset. Love and regards.”
