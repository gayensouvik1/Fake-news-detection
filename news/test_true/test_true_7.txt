An interesting sight could be seen at Delhi Chief Minsiter’s rally in Gautam Vihar Chowk area, where the crowds could be seen chanting ‘Modi Modi’instead of coming forward in support of Aam Aadmi Party Chief.

With Delhi MCD elections around the corner, Kejriwal could be seen fuming after hearing thecrowd, which he thought was gathered in his support; cheered for PM Modi instead.

Kejriwal gives a ‘befitting’ reply:

Lashing out at the Modi supporters at the rally, CM raises several issues which his government ‘faces’ because of lack of cooperation between the MCD and his government.

Responding to the crowd, Kejriwal said “Because of MCD strikes; the whole city gets covered in heap of garbage”,CM later assured that after his party takes charge of MCD, he would ensure the salaries of the MCD employees reach them by 7th of every month.

Thereafter, CM went ahead and said, “If one can evade ‘house tax’ by screaming ‘Modi Modi’ then even I would start saying it all the time”.

He further attacked the PM followers and asked “if Modi has reduced your electricity prices?”

CM further told the crowd that one can’t fill their stomach by raising pro-Modi slogans and addressed them as ‘stupid’ for blindly favouring PM Modi.
