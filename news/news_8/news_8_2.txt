Sonakshi Sinha has never looked leaner and fitter. The actress, who has constantly been written about for her weight, says, “Earlier, I was under the impression that I don't have to control my diet if I exercise well. But now, I have realised that small changes in your diet go a long way . So, I have cut off junk food completely . `Kha ke workout kar lenge' -this attitude doesn't work. And of course, gymming, cardio, yoga and dancing also keep me fit.“

Sonakshi says that fitness has also changed the way she dresses. She elaborates, “As you grow fitter, you realise that you look and feel good a lot more. Clothes also fit well like never before.“

As far as her work goes she says, “I have achieved commercial success to last a lifetime. Now, I can pick and choose roles that will push me to my limits.“ So, is there any truth to the rumours that she is all set to tie the knot soon?

“Marriage is not on the cards anytime soon. In fact, I don't even know what kind of guy I'd like to get married to. Let people talk...log to kahenge...logon ka kaam hai kehna,“ she sums up.
