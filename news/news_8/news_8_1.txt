Ever since they were spotted together, Sonakshi Sinha and Bunty Sajdeh have been sparking off rumours that they are much in love, with reports even saying that they are engaged to be married. They have been spotted at various spots but they do their best to avoid getting clicked by paparazzi. With the engagement rumours getting stronger than before, there was a gossip going on that Sonakshi might not be taking up any more projects after the Ittefaq remake, as she will be readying herself up for the marriage.

However, Sonakshi Sinha has a different (and actually, quite expected) take on the grapevine. She not only denied that she is getting married anytime soon, she even refuted rumours that she is seeing anyone at the moment. In an interview with Bombay Times, she said, “Marriage is not on the cards anytime soon. In fact, I don’t even know what kind of guy I’d like to get married to. Let people talk…log to kahenge…logon ka kaam hai kehna!”

Well, if that’s the case, why not be clear about things and make your stance about Bunty clear to your fans? These two were even spotted as recently as last week when they were seen together at Anushka Sharma’s special screening, where they arrived together in the same car. There have also been rumours that her mother, Poonam Sinha, is not quite approving of their supposed relationship, so is that the reason why the duo have been keeping things discreet? Or perhaps, we have been reading too much between the lines.

Sonakshi Sinha will be next seen in an author backed role in Noor, which is based on a book. She will be playing a harried journalist who stumbles upon a scoop that changes her life forever.
