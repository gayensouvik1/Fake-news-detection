It wouldn't be an understatement to say Delhi Daredevils' Sanju Samson was on fire yesterday. The young player scored his maiden ton in 62 balls. The Kerala boy slammed six boundaries to bring up his half century followed by five massive sixes and two boundaries for his century. 

At the end of the batting innings for DD when Samson was asked about his performance, the 22-year-old said that he was at a loss of words. But social media went into a tizzy with love and wishes pouring in for Samson whose knock boosted Delhi's score to 205 runs for the loss of 4 wickets at the end of 20 overs. Not just the Daredevils fans, but even celebs took to Twitter to wish the batsman.

Cricket's beloved Harsha Bhogle expressed his delight and called Samson a fine talent. 
Rajasthan Royals owner Raj Kundra too took to Twitter to extend his warm wishes to Samson who once used to play for his team. While with Rajasthan Royals, Samson has to his name yet another record - the youngest player to achieve a half century and also the youngest to score 1000 runs in IPL.
Hoping that Samson grows as a batsman, retired cricketer Aakash Chopra, Ravichandran Ashwin and New Zealand cricketer Brendon McCullum took to Twitter wish Samson on his achievement.
Sports statistician Mohandas Menon also congratulated Samson with interesting trivia on how Samson is the second youngest player to score a ton in IPL after Manish Pandey.
