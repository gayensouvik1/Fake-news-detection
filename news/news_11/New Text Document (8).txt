The Indian Premier League's first centurion Brendon McCullum was all praise for Sanju Samson, who hammered the first century of this year's IPL.

McCullum hammered 158* off 73 balls for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the first ever match of the IPL back in 2008 versus the Royal Challengers Bangalore. His innings included 10 fours and 13 sixes as he lit up the Chinnaswamy on the first ever day of the IPL.

India's star off-spinner and the injured Ravichandran Ashwin was also all praise for the young boy from Kerala.

Joining McCullum and Ashwin in praise of Samson was Harsha Bhogle, who praised the innings and his talent. His former employers and the now suspended Rajasthan Royals and the owner of the suspended team Raj Kundra also tweeted about the brillaint knock by the 22-year-old.

Samson hammered his century off just 62 balls before falling to a Adam Zampa flipper for 102. With this he became the second youngest Indian to slam a ton in the IPL, first being Manish Pandey, who hammered a ton back in 2009 in South Africa at the age of 19.

Coming in at no. 3, he steadied the ship for the Delhi Daredevils after Deepak Chahar picked up Aditya Tare early in the innings.

He started his innings showing some great timing and hitting a flurry of boundaries. Samson settled in and took 41 balls to reach his fifty but continued the good work before finally bringing his hundred up with a big six off Zampa in the 19th over. He hit eight fours and five sixes in his knock of 102.
