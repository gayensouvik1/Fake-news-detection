The deceased hail from different areas of Punjab; 11 from Sargodha, two from Islamabad, two from Layyah and one each from Mianwali and Pir Mahal, while one dead body of a woman could not be identified

Police have arrested Abdul Waheed along with his four close associates and shifted them to an undisclosed location.
