The government cannot make Aadhaar mandatory for extending benefits of its welfare schemes, the Supreme Court says.

The government however, cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar in other schemes like opening of bank accounts, the court says.

Meanwhile, on the matter of hearing pleas that challenge use of Aadhaar, the court said that a seven-member bench is required to hear these petitions and right now it was not possible.
