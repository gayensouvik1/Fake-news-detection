The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the Government cannot make Aadhaar card mandatory for it's welfare schemes, reports said.
The top court, however, said the Government can not be stopped either ‘from using aadhaar in other schemes like opening of bank accounts and filing of income tax’.

"Aadhaar can't be mandatory for social welfare schemes but can be used for non-benefit schemes. Our earlier order is very clear. You can't stop government from using Aadhaar for non-benefit schemes like Income Tax," Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said.

Meanwhile, on the matter of hearing pleas that challenge use of Aadhaar, the court said that a seven-member bench is required to hear these petitions, but right now it is  not possible.

The apex court's ruling came after the Government  announced making Aadhaar mandatory for income tax returns and PAN cards.

The Government  also issued directives to telecom operators to re-verify users using Aadhaar-based process.
