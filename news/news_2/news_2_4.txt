Aadhaar can’t be mandatory for central welfare schemes, the Supreme Court said on Monday, but added that it cannot stop the government from linking the Aadhaar number to the opening of bank accounts or filing of tax returns.

The top court further observed that a 7-judge bench has to be set up to hear the pleas challenging Aadhaar, but right now it was not possible.

Recently the government has decided to make Aadhaar number mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns and compulsory linking it with PAN card.

Apart from it the government has also made it mandatory for citizens to produce Aadhaar number for benefits under various central schemes including free mid-day meals for schoolchildren, scholarships, subsidized cooking gas and foodgrains., driving licences etc.
